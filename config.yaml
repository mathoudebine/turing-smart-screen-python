config:
  # Configuration values to set up basic communication
  # Set your COM port e.g. COM3 for Windows, /dev/ttyACM0 for Linux...
  # Use AUTO for COM port auto-discovery (may not work on every setup)
  # COM_PORT: "/dev/ttyACM0"
  # COM_PORT: "COM3"
  COM_PORT: "AUTO"

  # Theme to use (located in res/themes)
  # Use the name of the folder as value
  # Choose a theme made for your screen size (see DISPLAY_SIZE inside theme.yaml)
  THEME: 3.5inchTheme2

  # Hardware sensors reading
  # Choose the appropriate method for reading your hardware sensors:
  # - PYTHON         use Python libraries (psutils, GPUtil...) to read hardware sensors (supports all OS but not all HW)
  # - LHM            use LibreHardwareMonitor library to read hardware sensors (Windows only - NEEDS ADMIN RIGHTS)
  # - STUB / STATIC  use random/static data instead of real hardware sensors
  # - AUTO           use the best method based on your OS: Windows OS will use LHM, other OS will use Python libraries
  HW_SENSORS: AUTO

  # Network interfaces
  # Linux/MacOS interfaces are named "eth0", "wlan0", "wlp1s0", "enp2s0"...
  # For Windows use the interfaces pretty name: "Ethernet 2", "Wi-Fi", ...
  # Leave the fields empty if the card does not exist on your setup
  ETH: "" # Ethernet Card
  WLO: "" # Wi-Fi Card

  # CPU fan
  # For Linux/MacOS platforms, the CPU fan is amongst all fan sensors gathered from the motherboard chipset
  # If value is AUTO the system monitor will try to auto-select the CPU fan
  # If auto-detection fails, it might be necessary to manually indicate which fan is the CPU fan
  # Value must be 'controller/fan' e.g. 'nct6798/fan2'. Use configuration wizard for help in selection
  CPU_FAN: AUTO
