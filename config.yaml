  # Hardware sensors reading
  # Choose the appropriate method for reading your hardware sensors:
  # - PYTHON         use Python libraries (psutils, GPUtil...) to read hardware sensors (supports all OS but not all HW)
  # - LHM            use LibreHardwareMonitor library to read hardware sensors (Windows only - NEEDS ADMIN RIGHTS)
  # - STUB / STATIC  use random/static data instead of real hardware sensors
  # - AUTO           use the best method based on your OS: Windows OS will use LHM, other OS will use Python libraries
  HW_SENSORS: AUTO

  # Network interfaces
  # Linux/MacOS interfaces are named "eth0", "wlan0", "wlp1s0", "enp2s0"...
  # For Windows use the interfaces pretty name: "Ethernet 2", "Wi-Fi", ...
  # Leave the fields empty if the card does not exist on your setup
  ETH: "" # Ethernet Card
  WLO: "" # Wi-Fi Card
